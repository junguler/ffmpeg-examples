# ffmpeg examples
this repo is dedicated to show examples of how i use ffmpeg for what i do, it plans to cover a wide range of topics in the long run but we'll start with basic every day uses

## what you need to get started
youtube-dl to download royalty free videos from youtube as a source

ffmpeg to demux. mux, convert and apply different filters

primitive, geometrize and gmic for applying different filters to our image sequences

a terminal with access to bash or zsh, if you are on windows this does not come by default but it's very easy to install and use, there are many projects dedicated to bringing bash and other posix tool to linux. among them i recommend: cygwin, git bash for windows, msys2 or wsl/2 if you are a little more advanced
