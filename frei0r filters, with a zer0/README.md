### frei0r filters examples
[frei0r](https://frei0r.dyne.org/) is a free collection of cool looking video filters that does not come built into ffmpeg or mpv by default, 
you need find a version that is specifically compiled for this or compile ffmpeg/mpv yourself and add this library to them
which is outsite of my knowledge and scoop of this repo.

### our source clip, i'll try to use the same clip for all the filter examples as to make it easier to compare
