here i try to show some example of cool looking filters ffmepg has and how easy it is to use them on mpv as a toggle,
make sure ffmpeg is on your $PATH and open the terminal and cd into the clip folder and lets go

### our source clip, i'll try to use the same clip for all the filter examples as to make it easier to compare
